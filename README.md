## 🚀 About Me  
I'm a robotics student with a strong interest in AI, machine learning, and startups. My focus lies in the intersection of intelligent systems and real-world machines. From mechanical builds like a robotic arm to machine learning collaborations with TV2 and Cogito, I’m constantly experimenting with new ideas that bring code to life. My goal is to create impactful and intelligent technology that bridges software and hardware in meaningful ways.



-  **Currently working on**: Expanding my robotics projects by integrating AI and ML for smarter behavior  
-  **Favorite tools**: C++, Python, Arduino, Open-cv, and anything I can bolt to a motor  
-  **Hobbies**: Running, climbing, lifting, and building stuff that moves  
-  **Professional goal**: Build intelligent machines that learn, adapt, and make a real-world difference!

## 🛠️ Projects I’m Proud Of  
- 🤖 **Robotic Arm**: A hands-on mechanical arm project that sparked my interest in fusing robotics with machine learning.  
- 🤝 **TV2 x Cogito Collaboration**: Worked on a machine learning project in collaboration with TV2 and Cogito, using historical data to improve editorial decision-making through predictive models.
- 🏫 **[finnemnet.no](https://finnemnet.no/)**: Made a website for NTNU students to easier find courses that they are interested in. Using RAG, OpenAI embeddings & LLM's.
